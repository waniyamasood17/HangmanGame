## Hangman (C)

A simple, polished console Hangman game written in C for Windows. Choose a category, guess letters, and reveal the hidden word before you run out of tries. The program includes robust input validation, duplicate-guess protection, and a clear visual display of the hangman and guessed letters.

### Features
- **Three categories**: cars, people, countries
- **Random word selection** every game
- **Input validation** for category, single-letter guesses, and replay prompt
- **Duplicate guess protection** (no extra penalty for repeating letters)
- **Visual hangman** and live display of guessed letters
- **Replay loop** to keep playing without restarting the app

## Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- A C compiler:
  - **GCC (MinGW/WinLibs/LLVM for Windows)**, or
  - **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools)**

---

## Build Instructions (Windows)

### Option A: GCC (MinGW)
If `gcc` is on your PATH:

```powershell
gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -o Hangman_code.exe Hangman_code.c
./Hangman_code.exe
```

If you installed MinGW but `gcc` is not recognized, add MinGW's `bin` directory to PATH or run from the MinGW shell.

### Option B: MSVC (cl.exe)
Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS" (or Developer PowerShell) and run:

```bat
cl /W4 /O2 Hangman_code.c
Hangman_code.exe
```

## How to Play
1. Select a category (1 = Car names, 2 = Person names, 3 = Country names).
2. Type a single alphabet letter to guess.
3. You have 6 incorrect tries. The hangman drawing updates after each wrong guess.
4. Guessed letters are shown so you can avoid repeats.
5. After win/lose, choose whether to play again (y/n).

Tips:
- Only letters are accepted. Uppercase is converted to lowercase.
- Repeating a letter is allowed but will not cost a try.

## Project Structure
- `Hangman_code.c` — main source file
- `Hangman_code.exe` — compiled executable (generated by build)

---

## Code Overview
Main functions you can explore or modify in `Hangman_code.c`:
- `get_a_word(category, &words)` — fills a small word set for the chosen category.
- `hangman_display(tries)` — renders the hangman ASCII art for the current number of wrong tries.
- `word_display(word, length, guesses, &word_found)` — prints the masked/revealed word and determines if it’s fully guessed.
- `guess_check(word, guess, guesses)` — returns whether the guess is in the word and ensures it’s tracked.
- `read_category()` — validated input (1–3) with buffer clean-up.
- `read_yes_no()` — validated replay prompt ('y' or 'n').
- `read_guess(guesses)` — reads a single alphabet letter, prevents duplicates.
- `print_guessed_letters(guesses)` — prints all letters guessed so far.

## Adding More Words or Categories
The current implementation uses a simple struct with three words per category. To add more:
- Extend the `WordCategory` struct and selection logic, or
- Replace it with an array/list of strings per category and select using `rand()`.

Example idea (not implemented yet):
```c
// Pseudocode
const char* cars[] = {"bently", "tucson", "mehran", "civic", "corolla"};
size_t car_count = sizeof(cars)/sizeof(cars[0]);
const char* word = cars[rand() % car_count];
```

## Troubleshooting
- "gcc is not recognized": Install MinGW/WinLibs or MSYS2, then add its `bin` to PATH or use its shell.
- Clear screen not working: The program uses `system("cls")`, which requires the Windows console. If suppressed by your environment, remove or replace these calls.
- Weird characters/locale: Words are ASCII. If you add non-ASCII, ensure your console code page supports them.

---

## Roadmap (Ideas)
- Load words from external text files.
- Track and display wrong letters separately from correct ones.
- Difficulty levels and scoring.
- Cross-platform clear-screen handling.
